A sample WebApi with the purpose of returning the number of distinct words in the text. 
E.g. the text "a horse and a dog" has 4 distinct words ["a", "horse", "and", "dog"]


Improvement notes: 

"SplitIntoDistinctWords" needs more test cases

"SplitIntoDistinctWords" implemented very quickly (any problems with the implementation? performance?)
